# ui-progressbar-quote

I wanted to make a screen simulation with either images and/or quotes on a color-changing background.

You can change:
- background and/or images with same quote 
- background and/or quote with same image
- background and/or images and change quote
- import images from public/images

You can change background color.

## Install

`$ git clone ...`
`$ cd vite-project`
`$ pnpm install`

## Features

- Quote from API call https://api.quotable.io/random
- Img from API call https://picsum.photos/1600/1000 & from public/images
- progressbar with framer-motion (display percent and percentage change)
